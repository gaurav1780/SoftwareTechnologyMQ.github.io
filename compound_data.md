  * Understand how larger chunks of data are stored in a program
  * Understand how to access these larger chunks of data
  * Understand the most common data chunks, arrays
</details>

So far we have been working only with _atomic_ data.  That is data that is "just one thing" and can't be broken up.  This is getting unwieldy.  Everytime we have something to draw, we need to have an x-position and a y-position and so we need two variables for something we probably think of as just one thing (the position on the screen).

Wouldn't it be nice to have just one variable for both?  Yes, yes it would.  

The facility we need for this is _composite data_.  We need a way to put two values (the x and the y positions) into a single variable.  What type would this be?  Not an `int` or a `float` or a `char`!  Processing _does_ have types we can use for this, but they act a little differently from the types we already know.

Let me introduce you to one of these types, `PVector`.  

Recall that processing has _values_ (like 1,c,4.5) that are grouped into _types_ (like `int`, `char`, `float`).  It is possible to have a value with two numbers in it, that value would be of the type `PVector`:

  * (1,1) is a `PVector` with two values in it, `1` and `1`
  * (10,4) is a `PVector` with two values in it, `10` and `4`.

So you can see that we have a whole new type and a whole new set of values that fit into that type.  Lets play with it.

[The Processing website has an example of using `PVectors`](https://processing.org/examples/bouncingball.html) for a bouncing ball program.  Study it carefully.

You will notice two interesting features that we will now discuss:

  * the use of "dot-notation" to get inside the compound data
  * the use of `new` for an extra step in the declare-and-initialise process.

## Compound Data in Memory

So, compound data is _bigger_, so much so, that it can't fit into a single memory slot.  _But_ variables can only point to single buckets, so what do we do?

For compound data, a variable will point to one memory location that then tells you _where the larger chunk of memory is_.
<aside markdown="1">
Note that the reasons for this way of doing things are myriad.  In the end, it is the right way but we don't need to know all the reasons, we only need to know that it is so and know how to work with it.  Atomic data (`int`, `float`, `char`) is stored directly in their memory slot but compound data stored a "reference" to another location where the compound data is really stored.

So, an extra step is required, making the memory box point to another, larger, chunk of memory.  This is what `new` does.  It finds some free space that is big enough, and sets aside that much space.  Lets call this step "memory allocation".

The other new step is to "follow the arrow" from the memory box to the bigger chunk and to pull out one part from there.  This is what the `.` does.  It follows the arrow and then uses the special name that comes after to get one of the values from the larger chunk.  Lets call this step "de-referencing".

Processing actually has two different forms of compound data - objects like `PVector` (and many others), and arrays.  We will focus on arrays from here but feel free to use objects whenenver you like.

Note:  objects are often taught with a related concept - classes - however, we will not address classes in any way at this point.

Note that the two different versions of compound data come with two different syntaxes for dereferences - for objects is it `.name` and for arrays it is `[number]`.  See below for details.

# Arrays

To understand how to use compound data, we will look at the most common compound data type, arrays.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NptnmWvkbTw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

An array is a fixed-sized collection of items, each item of the same type.

So you can have,

- an array of 5 integers
- an array of 20 booleans
- an array of 2000 characters
- an array of 50 Strings
- an array of 400 arrays
- and so on...

## Perhaps the most important concept to understand in arrays is the difference between a *reference* and an *instance*.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/WV2tRAlb4Qc741GHVn/giphy.gif)

### ***Reference*** - the variable name by which you know the array

### ***Instance*** - the actual collection of items to which a reference refers.

## Syntax to create an array

There are a few ways to create an array.

### Creating array - Option 1

The most common way to create an array is by specifying the type and size of the array.

```processing
type[] arrayName = new type[size];
```

**NOTE**: This only works when the array is first created (more on this later) 

#### Example - integer array

```processing
int[] arr = new int[5]; //an array that holds 5 integers
```

![](./assets/images/intArray.png)

**Reference**: `arr`

**Instance**: the block with 5 integer values

-----------------

#### Example - boolean array

```processing
boolean[] flags = new boolean[4]; //an array that holds 4 booleans
```

![](./assets/images/booleanArray.png)

**reference**: `flags` 

**instance**: the block with 4 boolean values

-----------------

### Creating array - Option 2

When you know the values that need to be stored in the array beforehand, you can create an array as,

```processing
type[] arrayName = {item1, item2, ....};
```

#### Examples

```processing
int[] taxicab = {10, 70, 20, 90};
```

![](./assets/images/intArrayPopulated.png)

**reference**: `taxicab`

**instance**: the block with the integer values `10, 70, 20, 90` 

-----------------

```processing
int[] cutoffs = {50, 65, 75, 85};
char[] punctuations = {'.', '!', '?', ',', ';', ':'};
double[] significantNumbers = {3.141, 1.618, 2.718, 57.295, 1.202, 1.414};
boolean[] twentyTwo = {true, false, true, true, false};
```

# Size of an array

The number of items in an array `arr` is given by `arr.length`.

<div class="aside" markdown="1">
Note that, given what we said above this means `.length` should be read as "follow the reference and see how large the chunk of memory at the other end is".
</div>

For example,

```processing
int[] data = new int[20];
println(data.length); //displays 20
```

# Accessing items of an array

- The first item of an array `arr` is at index 0.
- The second item of an array `arr` is at index 1.
- ...
- The last item of an array `arr` is at index `arr.length - 1`.

Thus you can traverse an array using a loop from `0` to `arr.length - 1` as,

```processing
for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
	//do what you want with arr[i]
}
```

#### Example

Create an array that holds the outcome of 20 dice rolls.

Each dice roll is a random integer between 1 and 6.

```processing
int[] outcomes = new int[20];
for(int i=0; i < outcomes.length; i++) {
	outcomes[i] = (int)random(1, 7); //remember 7 is not included
}
```

Then we can find out the average outcome as,

```processing
int total  = 0;
for(int i=0; i < outcomes.length; i++) {
	total += outcomes[i];
}
double average = (total * 1.0)/outcomes.length;
//multiplication with 1.0 to convert int to double
```

# Re-referencing an array

Remember how we noted that the following only works when the array is FIRST created?
	
```processing
int[] taxi = {10, 70, 20, 90};
```

If we split this statement, it would be:

```processing
int[] taxi; //declaration - creates the reference

// following ATTEMPTS to link the reference to the instance. 
// BUT SYNTACTICALLY INVALID

taxi = {90, 20, 70, 10}; //INCORRECT
```

Once an array reference is created, to re-reference it to a new instance, you have to use the following syntax:

```processing
arrayName = new Type[size];
```

or 

```processing
arrayName = new Type[]{item1, item2, ...};
```

For example,

```processing
taxicab = {90, 20, 70, 10}; 			//INCORRECT
taxicab = new int[]{90, 20, 70, 10}; 	//CORRECT
```

```processing
boolean[] switches;

switches = {true, false, true}; 				//INCORRECT
switches = new boolean[]{true, false, true}; 	//CORRECT
```

You can also re-reference an array to another instance already created (and referenced by some other array). Here's how...

# Copying an array into another array

When an array, say `src`, is copied into another array, say `dest`, both references - `src` and `dest` - refer to the instance to which `src` was originally referring.


```processing
int[] src = {10, 70, 20, 90};
int[] dest = src;
```

![](./assets/images/arrayRefCopy.png)

We call this a ***reference copy***.

**NOTE:** The type of arrays must be the same. You cannot copy an `int` array into a `float` array. The following will not work:

```processing
int[] taxi = {10, 70, 20, 90};
float[] cab = taxi; //Compilation error!
```

### Another example

```processing
int[] a = {70, 80, 60};
int[] b = {10, 70, 20, 90};
int[] c = a;
a = b;
```

- After the first line, there is one reference and one instance.

![](./assets/images/refCopyStep1.png)

- After the second line, there are two references and two instances.

![](./assets/images/refCopyStep2.png)

- After the third line, there are three references but still, only two instances. Currently, `a` and `c` refer to the same instance.

![](./assets/images/refCopyStep3.png)

- After the fourth line, there are three references but still, only two instances. Now, `a` and `b` refer to the same instance.

![](./assets/images/refCopyStep4.png)

# Passing an array to a function

When you pass an array to a function, a reference copy of the actual parameter is made into the formal parameter. Thus, the array inside the function refers to the same array that was passed.

```processing
void setup() {
	int[] data = {10, 70, 20, 90};
	int sum = total(data); //outputs 190
}

int total(int[] arr) {
	int result = 0;
	for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		result+=arr[i];
	}
	return result;
}
```

Here, `arr` is a reference copy of `data`.

![](./assets/images/passingArrayToFunction.png)


Another example:

![](./assets/images/passingArrayToFunction.drawio.png)


## Modifying array contents inside a function

When you modify the **contents of** an array inside a function, the **contents of** the passed array are also modified, because we are operating on the reference copy (see previous diagram).

```processing
void setup() {
	int[] data = {10, 70, 20, 90};
	negate(data);
	for(int i=0; i < data.length; i++) {
		print(data[i]+" ");
	} //outputs -10 -70 -20 -90
}

void negate(int[] arr) {
	int result = 0;
	for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		arr[i]*=-1;
	}
}
```

![](./assets/images/modifyingArrayContentsInsideFunction.png)


## Modifying an array itself inside a function

When you modify (re-reference) the array itself inside a function, the passed array is NOT modified, because we re-referenced the reference copy.

```processing
void setup() {
	int[] data = {10, 70, 20, 90};
	expand(data);
	for(int i=0; i < data.length; i++) {
		print(data[i]+" ");
	} //outputs 10 70 20 90
}

void expand(int[] arr) {
	arr = new int[10];
}
```

![](./assets/images/modifyingArrayInsideFunction.png)

## Returning an array from a function

You can always create an array and return it from a function

### Example 1 (with memory diagram)

![](./assets/images/functionReturningArray.drawio.png)

### Example 2

```processing
void setup() {
	int[] data = {10, 70, -20, -90, 30, 80, 60, 0, -50};
	
	int[] sub = getFirst(data, 4);
	
	for(int i=0; i < sub.length; i++) {
		print(sub[i]+" ");
	} //outputs 10 70 -20 -90
	
	int[] bar = getFirst(data, 2);
	for(int i=0; i < bar.length; i++) {
		print(bar[i]+" ");
	} //outputs 10 70
	
	
	for(int i=0; i < data.length; i++) {
		print(data[i]+" ");
	} //outputs 10 70 -20 -90 30 80 60 0 -50
}

int[] getFirst(int[] arr, int n) { //we assume n>=0, n<arr.length
	int[] result = new int[n];
	for(int i=0; i < n; i++) {
		result[i] = arr[i];
	}
	return result;
}
```

### Example 3

```processing
void setup() {
	int[] data = {10, 70, -20, -90, 30, 80, 60, 0, -50};
	
	int[] negs = getNegativeItems(data);
	
	for(int i=0; i < negs.length; i++) {
		print(negs[i]+" ");
	} //outputs -20 -90 -50
	
	for(int i=0; i < data.length; i++) {
		print(data[i]+" ");
	} //outputs 10 70 -20 -90 30 80 60 0 -50
}

int[] getNegativeItems(int[] arr) {
	int count = 0;
	for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		if(arr[i] < 0) { //negative
			count++;
		}
	}
	
	int[] result = new int[count]; 
	
	int destIndex = 0;
	for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		if(arr[i] < 0) { //negative
			result[destIndex] = arr[i];
			destIndex++;
		}
	}
	return result;
}
```

# Instance copy

When you want to *duplicate* or *clone* an array, you can create an array of the same size as the original array, and copy all items over. This is known as *instance copy*.

```processing
int[] source = {10, 70, 20, 90};

//creating an instance copy of source into destination -

int[] destination = new int[source.length]; //same size as source
for(int i=0; i < source.length; i++) {
	destination[i] = source[i];
}
```

1. An array `a` that has capacity for 2000 integers.
2. An array `b` that has capacity for 5000 characters.
3. An array `c` that has capacity for 666 booleans.
4. An array `d` that has capacity for 1 float.
5. An array `e` containing the values `5, 6, 7, 8`.
6. An array `f` containing the values `false, true, true`.
7. An array `g` containing the values `'M', 'e', 's', 's', 'i'`.
8. An array `h` containing the values `1.414, 7.2, -2.5, 9.81`.

## Exercise 2

1. Assume the existence of integer array `tom` and make a reference copy of `tom` into `jerry`.
1. Assume the existence of boolean array `aang` and make a reference copy of `aang` into `katara` as well as `toph`.

## Exercise 3

Draw the memory diagram for the following code,

```processing
int[] data = new int[]{50, 90, 30, 20, 60};
```

## Exercise 4

Draw the memory diagram for the following code,

```processing
int[] data = new int[6];
for(int i=0; i < data.length; i++) {
	if(i%2 == 0) {
		data[i] = 2*i+1;
	}
	else {
		data[i] = -3*i;
	}
}
```

## Exercise 6

List the references and instance created in the following code.

```processing
int[] a = {10, 70, 20, 90};
int[] b = a;
char[] c = {'h', 'e', 'y', '!'};
char[] d = c;
boolean b = new boolean[10];
```

## Exercise 7

Explain why the following code will not compile.

```processing
int[] a = {10, 70, 20, 90};
int[] b = new int[10];
b[2] = a;
```

## Exercise 8

Write a piece of code that creates the arrays represented in the following diagram.

![](./assets/images/refCopyProblem1.png)

## Exercise 9

Write a piece of code that creates the arrays represented in the following diagram.

![](./assets/images/refCopyProblem2.png)

## Exercise 10

Draw the memory diagram for the following code,

```processing
int[] a = {4,8,15,16,23,42};
int[] b = a;
b[2] = 100;
b = new int[]{104,101,108,108,111};
```

## Exercise 11

Write a piece of code that creates an array with 100 integers, each between 1 and 20. Count the number of items that are divisible by the item after them.

For example, if the first few items of the array are `{20, 5, 8, 4, 4, ...}`, 20 is divisible by 5, 8 is divisible by 4, and 4 is divisible by 4, so we have 3 such items so far.

## Exercise 12

Consider the following piece of code.

```processing
int[] items = new int[10];
items[0] = 1;
for(int i=1; i < items.length; i++) {
	items[i] = 2 * items[i-1];
}
```

What are the contents of the array `items`?

## Exercise 13

Complete the following function defintiion. The name of the function clearly indicates what is expected from the function.

```processing
int countPositiveItems(float[] data) {
	return 0; //to be completed
}
```

## Exercise 14

Define a function that when passed an integer array, returns the number of odd numbers in the array.

## Exercise 15

Define a function that when passed two boolean arrays, returns `true` if they contain the same number of items, `false` otherwise. 

## Exercise 16

Define a function that when passed two floating-point arrays that are guaranteed to be of the same lengths, returns an array where each item is the product of the corresponding items in the passed arrays.

For example, if the arrays passed are `{1.2, 1.5, 1.3}` and `{1.8, 1.6, 1.9}`, the array returned should be `{1.2*1.8, 1.5*1.6, 1.4*1.9}`.

## Exercise 17

Define a function that when passed a `char` array, returns the reverse of the array. The array passed should NOT be modified.

The state of 25 electrical switches is held in an array `smartSwitches`. The states can be "On" (true) or "Off" (false). Write a piece of code that toggles all switches. That is, all switches that are currently "On" should turn "Off", and all switches that are currently "Off" should turn "On".

Assume that we are encoding birthdays as integers where:

- 1st january is 0,
- 2nd january is 1,
- and so on till,
- 31st december is 365

(remember that 29th february will also be given an integer mapping).

The birthdays of 1000 people is stored in an array `bdays`. Write a piece of code that displays the most frequent date of birth. For the basic version, you may display an integer between 0 and 365. For the advanced version, display the actual data in `DD/MM` format.

//assuming bdays is an array containing 1000 items

frequencies holds number of birthdays on each of the 366 days.
if a birthday falls on 1st jan (coded as 0), frequencies[0] increases by 1

...
if a birthday falls on 32st dec (coded as 365), frequencies[365] increases by 1

I keep track of the time taken (in minutes) to run each kilometer over a 100km race (let me dream!). These times are stored in an array `lapTimes`. For example, if `lapTimes[0]` is 6.23, it means I ran the first kilometer in 6 minutes 13.8 seconds.

Write a piece of code that determines my fastest lap (for example, display "Kilometer 0-1" if the first kilometer was the fastest, and "Kilometer 63-64" if the 64th kilometer was the fastest.)
